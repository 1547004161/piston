# Piston Tutorial

## Introduction

Piston is a game engine focusing on user friendliness, back-end agnostic interface and research game development using the Rust language. With Piston you should be able get something up on the screen quickly, make a prototype, polish it to look like a real game and port it to other platforms. Our goal is to provide the tools for creative game development, build the best 2D graphics API for Rust and make it easy to use with other libraries for game development in the Rust community.

Rust is a programming language with a focus on type safety, memory safety, concurrency and performance. It is intended for writing large-scale, high-performance software that is free from several classes of common errors. Rust has a sophisticated memory model that encourages efficient data structures and safe concurrency patterns, forbidding invalid memory accesses that would otherwise cause segmentation faults. It is statically typed and compiled ahead of time. For more information see http://www.rust-lang.org/
